# Planning and Workflow

## Plan Mode

- Make plans extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for brevity.
- End each plan with unresolved questions, if any.

## When to Clarify vs Execute

Simple/clear tasks: execute immediately.
Complex/ambiguous tasks: clarify first, then proceed autonomously.

Only ask for help when:
- Scripts timeout (>2min)
- Sudo is needed
- Genuine blockers arise

## Constraint Persistence

When user defines constraints ("never X", "always Y", "from now on"):
1. Acknowledge
2. Persist to AGENTS.md
3. Confirm
