# Code Quality

## DRY

Strictly enforce DRY. Refactor ruthlessly to eliminate redundancy.

## No Guessing

Never guess numerical values - benchmark instead.
When uncertain, measure. Say "this needs to be measured" rather than inventing statistics.

## Scaling

Validate at small scale before scaling up.
Run a sub-minute version first to verify the pipeline works.
When scaling, only the scale parameter should change.
